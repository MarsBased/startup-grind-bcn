        <h2>Core values</h2>
        <p>We believe in making friends, not contacts. We believe in giving, not taking. We believe in helping others before helping yourself. We are truly passionate about helping founders, entrepreneurs and startups succeed. We intend to make their startup journey less lonely, more connected and more memorable</p>

        <h2>Community giveback</h2>
        <p>We stem from the Silicon Valley culture. The startups and successful entrepreneurs in Silicon Valley pay the ecosystem back in order to sustain it and keep the wheel turning. Thus, people at Facebook, Google and the like contribute heavily to Stanford University programs and initiatives, just to name a few.</p>
        <p>We are giving our entrepreneurs & startups the chance to be in the spotlight in the first hour of every event! Some events feature 5-10 minutes didactic talks to explain a business case, a failure/success story, a workshop, etc. No pitching here!</p>
        <p>The rest of the events have our most-acclaimed Open Mic. You can sign up to get 1-2 minutes of glory to explain your project and ask for help/new ideas/contributions/guidance for your business plan/a developer/a mentor/investment/etc.</p>
        <h2>Students</h2>
        <p>Not only do we visit universities and other learning centers to present Startup Grind and collaborate with their events & programs, but we also offer a special discount to every student in Barcelona. Get in touch with us through our <a href="/contact" title="Contact form">contact form</a>.</p>
        <h2>Extended family</h2>
        <p>We will offer students from all the universities the opportunity to collaborate in the Startup Grind events to help them get some exposure, visibility of their work and experience! By collaborating with us, you'll learn from the best!</p>
