        <h1>Values</h1>
        <h2>Core values</h2>
        <p>We believe in making friends, not contacts. We believe in giving, not taking. We believe in helping others before helping yourself. We are truly passionate about helping founders, entrepreneurs and startups succeed. We intend to make their startup journey less lonely, more connected and more memorable</p>

        <h2>Community giveback</h2>
        <p>We stem from the Silicon Valley culture. The startups and successful entrepreneurs in Silicon Valley pay the ecosystem back in order to sustain it and keep the wheel turning. Thus, people at Facebook, Google and the like contribute heavily to Stanford University programs and initiatives, just to name a few.</p>
        <p>From Startup Grind we want to thank the community for receiving us with open arms. We will get involved in social movements, NGOs and such as we grow bigger. Stay tuned for more information!</p>
        <h2>Donations</h2>
        <p>We will donate 10% of our ticket revenue to a different social project every month. Of course, we've got some under our radar, but you can also submit some suggestions to us using the <a href="/contact" title="Contact form">contact form</a>.</p>
        <h2>Student program</h2>
        <p>We will offer students from all the universities the opportunity to collaborate in the Startup Grind events to help them get some exposure, visibility of their work and experience! By collaborating with us, you'll learn from the best!</p>
