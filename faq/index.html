        <h1>FAQ</h1>
        <h2>What do you guys do?</h2>
        <p>We organize a monthly event where we interview someone we want to learn from. Entrepreneurs, investors, marketers, business people, tech gurus, and the like are subject to be interviewed at our events.</p>
        <p>The events are divided in three parts:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Community hour:</strong> We will kick off the event with a 10-minute keynote about interesting topics and an open mic where everybody is invited to ask on stage what he needs for his project during 60 seconds.</li>
          <li><strong>Fireside chat:</strong> Our speaker will be interviewed during 40 minutes, followed by a 20-minutes questions & answers section.</li>
          <li><strong>Networking:</strong> We'll wrap up the event with beverages & catering, networking with our speaker.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>How can I give a keynote during the Community Hour?</h2>
        <p>The Community Hour is our way to give back to the community we came from. The Community Hour is for you. If you can put an interesting keynote (10 minutes) focused on giving, not selling, then this is a match! If you're interested in giving a keynote in our next events, send an email to <a href="mailto:alexgg@startupgrind.com">alexgg@startupgrind.com</a>.</p>
        <h2>What does my ticket include?</h2>
        <p>Your ticket includes the access to the event. We normally give extra stuff, such as catering, beverages and other swag, but this is subject to change any time.</p>
        <h2>When does your event take place?</h2>
        <p>There is no fixed date and our dates depend on the venue's and the speaker's agenda. We try to schedule our events on Wednesday and Thursday evenings, but we can't guarantee it'll be always like this. Only one thing is clear: we host an event every month and it takes place between 18:30 and 21:30.</p>
        <h2>I met somebody really cool at your event but lost his contact. Where can I find him/her?</h2>
        <p>You don't have to wait for the next event to meet him/her. Try looking for your losts contacts in the <a href="https://bcnstartup.typeform.com/to/YV0pu1" title="Barcelona Startups community on Slack" target="_blank">Barcelona Startups community on Slack!</a></p>
        <h2>What language is your event conducted in?</h2>
        <p>Most of our events are conducted in Spanish. However, we will write on the newsletter and Meetup the language of the next event. On the other hand, we can't guarantee that the open mic or the keynote will be conducted in Spanish, so knowing Catalan and English won't hurt either. Our team is fully tri-lingual and always willing to help you.</p>
        <h2>When do you close doors?</h2>
        <p>We will be monitoring the entrance until 19.30. If you come later, you might not be able to get in.</p>
        <h2>I bought the ticket but cannot come to the event. Can I get a refund?</h2>
        <p>No. We do not offer refunds because we have running costs we don't get back if you cancel. However, write us an email and we will try to help.</p>
        <h2>I RSVP'd through Meetup and got a ticket there but the guys at the entrance will not let me in.</h2>
        <p>In every Meetup event you will find a link to the Startup Grind ticketing system, the only place where you can get a ticket for our events. If you did not buy a ticket through Startup Grind, you do not have a valid ticket and won't be allowed to join.</p>
        <h2>Can I buy a ticket at the door?</h2>
        <p>Because of legal reasons, we are not allowed to sell tickets for cash. If you want a ticket you can buy it using the Startup Grind website right on the spot, but we advise you to buy it in advance to secure a spot.</p>
        <h2>What can I say in the open mic and how do I register for it?</h2>
        <p>There's no registration. There is an open invitation during the first hour and you can jump in freely. You've got 60 seconds to ask for help and offer an exchange to the community.</p>
        <h2>What are your values?</h2>
        <p>We believe in making friends, not contacts. We believe in giving, not taking. We believe in helping others before helping yourself. We are truly passionate about helping founders, entrepreneurs and startups succeed. We intend to make their startup journey less lonely, more connected and more memorable.</p>
